- UDI: Ayah got his permanent residence permit approved at Politi, called them on Friday, got it approved 4 hours later, I have the ref ID. He called again today, and he said that the family will be approved too today. 
- UDI: Exchange? Is it possible to get an answer on this before June? 
- UDI: Traveling soon...
- UDI: The lady that I called last week told me that my father's case needs to be approved first before they can take a look at mine. I hope that this is possible now. I am also planning to send more documents in relation to my exchange from the Technical University of Munich.
