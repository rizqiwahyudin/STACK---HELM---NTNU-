    Introduction

Differentiation is a technique which can be used for analysing the way in which functions change. In
particular, it measures how rapidly a function is changing at any point. In engineering applications
the function may, for example, represent the magnetic field strength of a motor, the voltage across
a capacitor, the temperature of a chemical mix, and it is often important to know how quickly these
quantities change.

    In this Section we explain what is meant by the gradient of a curve and introduce differentiation as
a method for finding the gradient at any point.
