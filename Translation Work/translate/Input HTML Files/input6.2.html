<p>It will be worth keeping in mind that \(\coth(z)=\dfrac{\cosh(z)}{\sinh(z)}\). We start by rewriting the expression in terms of \(\sinh({@aa@}{@xx@})\) and \(\cosh({@aa@}{@xx@})\) as at least these are more like the expression we are targeting. For the numerator we use \[e^z=\cosh(z)+\sinh(z)\] while for denominator we can notice that this is already quite close to \(\sinh({@aa@}{@xx@})\) indeed \[ \sinh({@aa@}{@xx@})=\frac{e^{{@aa@}{@xx@}}-e^{-{@aa@}{@xx@}}}{2}.\]</p>
<p>Note that instead of spotting this we could just write each \(e^z=\cosh(z)+\sinh(z)\), there would be some cancelation after using the even / odd properties of \(\cosh(z)\) and \(\sinh(z)\). The result is of course the same. It's good exercise to confirm.</p>
<p>In any case, we can bring this together and simplify to see</p>
